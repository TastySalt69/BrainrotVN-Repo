testing commit

so guys I'm actually typing this from VSCode, by using the add on to clone the repo by going to the explorer button. then im editing this file, then I'll commit it using source control on the side.

now this is a separate branch I think. You guys will have to create and edit new branches first before going on the main branch. This is to make sure that ya'll dont fuck up and accidentally save erroneous code to the main branch and set everything back.

now that I've edited this, I can make a pull request to merge this into the main branch. Making a pull request is when you've made commits, tested ur code, and did what u wanted to do.
